# Railway-Inventory-Companion (RIC)
An Android and IOS app to help you inventorize your model railroad tracks

## Cross-platform
RIC is available on both Android and IOS platform so you can easely log all your model railroads tracks

## Open-source
RIC is written in dart and uses the Flutter framework. I decided to make it open-source because I think it's important to share with people.

## Languages
For now, RIC textes are written in English but as soon as I'll finish the alpha version, French and other languages will be added.

# Q&A
## Is RIC available ? 
Not yet. I'm currently working on it to achieve the first render that I've got in mind. 
RIC will certainly be available first on Android Play Store, but I'll managed to get it available on the App Store too.

## Are all my model railroad brand track compatible with RIC?
For now, only the Marklin tracks can be added in the app, as soon as the app will be available in alpha, I will work on the compatibility with other brands.
